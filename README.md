# Glassnode Code Challenges

The Glassnode Code Challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency with problem solving and collaboration skills we would expect you to use at Glassnode.

The Challenge creates a foundation for further onsite collaboration during your interview. Additionally, we want you to get a feel for some of the most common tasks you'll encounter at Glassnode.

## How to complete a Challenge

* Create a new git repository for your solution.
* Organize your work within that repository. When you get to a stopping point, publish it, preferably on github but you can just as well archive it and send it to us.

#### Time

We respect your time and the challenge is designed in such a way as not to take more than 4-6 hours.
We just want to get a sense of your thought process and the way you do the work.
If there are features you don't have time to implement, feel free to describe the intended approach to implementation in the README.

#### Your Challenge README

Include the following in your README:

* A description of the problem and solution.
* The reasoning behind your technical choices: trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you had additional time.
* What you'd do next and why.

#### Commit History

Use whatever development workflow works best for you. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that you keep your [commit history as clean as possible](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/codebase/dev/git/clean-commits/).

## What We Care About

Reviewing the application we'll look at the following aspects:

* **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
* **Correctness:** Does the submission accomplish what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code Quality:** Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
Is it aligned with the community-accepted way of solving similar problems?
* **Technical Choices:** Do choices of libraries, algorithms, and architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
